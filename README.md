This is an application for eBooks which utilizes the Datamuse API and the Merriam Webster API to return a definition of an unfamiliar word clicked on by the user.
The consensus is to combine our C# program (which uses the APIs to retrieve the definition) with a Unity program, as the plug-in shall be designed for use in Unity. The eBook shall be read within Unity, and a word searched through a searchbox shall be checked to make sure that word is within the eBook itself.

The name of our group is 12ThreEbooks.
