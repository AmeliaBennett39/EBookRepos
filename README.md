This is an application for eBooks which utilizes the Datamuse API and the Merriam Webster API to return a definition of an unfamiliar word clicked on by the user.
The consensus is to combine our C# program (which uses the APIs to retrieve the definition) with a Unity program, as the plug-in shall be designed for use in Unity. The eBook shall be read within Unity, and a word searched through a searchbox shall be checked to make sure that word is within the eBook itself.

The C# program is under the folder EBook Console Return. The Unity program is the Unity folder (the entirity of the folder and its contents is the Unity project). ChildrenEBook.zip is also the entire Unity program available for easy download.

The name of our group is 12ThreEbooks.
